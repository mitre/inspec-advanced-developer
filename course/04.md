## 4. SAF CLI
The SAF supports tools that can help you automate your security validation. This includes the [SAF CLI tool](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/).

If you are working in the course development lab environment, this tool is provided for you. If not, reference the page for installation guidance.

### 4.1. SAF CLI Capability
In addition to the documentation site, you can view the SAF CLI capabilities by running:
```sh
saf help
```

This will output:
```sh
The MITRE Security Automation Framework (SAF) Command Line Interface (CLI) brings together applications, techniques, libraries, and tools developed by MITRE and the security community to streamline security automation for systems and DevOps pipelines

USAGE
  $ saf [COMMAND]

TOPICS
  convert   [Normalize]    Convert security results from all your security tools between common data formats
  generate  [Validate]     Set pipeline thresholds
  harden    [Harden]       Implement security baselines using Ansible, Chef, and Terraform content: Visit https://saf.mitre.org/#/harden to explore and run hardening scripts
  plugins   List installed plugins.
  scan      [Validate]     Scan to get detailed security testing results: Visit https://saf.mitre.org/#/validate to explore and run inspec profiles
  validate  [Validate]     Verify pipeline thresholds
  view      [Visualize]    Identify overall security status and deep-dive to solve specific security defects

COMMANDS
  convert ckl2poam  Translate DISA Checklist CKL file(s) to POA&M files
  harden            Visit https://saf.mitre.org/#/harden to explore and run hardening scripts
  heimdall          Run an instance of Heimdall Lite to visualize your Data
  help              Display help for saf.
  plugins           List installed plugins.
  scan              Visit https://saf.mitre.org/#/validate to explore and run inspec profiles
  summary           Get a quick compliance overview of an HDF file
  version
```

You can get more information on a specific topic by running:
```sh
saf [TOPIC] -h
```

### 4.2. View Summary of Results
Let's try out using the SAF CLI to understand our InSpec scan results. 

You can view a summary of the results by running:
```sh
saf view summary -i path/to/output.json
```

This will show the high level information about the test results:
```sh
- profileName: my_nginx
  resultSets:
    - output.json
  compliance: 67
  passed:
    critical: 2
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 2
  failed:
    critical: 1
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 1
  skipped:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 0
  error:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 0
  no_impact:
    none: 0
    total: 0
```
### 4.3. Validate Results Against a Threshold
We can also generate a threshold for the results to be validated against. We will later see how this can be helpful in automated testing pipelines to indicate whether the pipeline should be considered a failure or a success.
